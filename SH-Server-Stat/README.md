# Server Stat Script    

This is based off the DevOps Roadmap Project [Server Performance Stats](https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats)

Stretch goals will be included. The script will output: 

- Total CPU Usage
- Total Memory Usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Total Disk Usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
- Top 5 Processes by CPU Usage 
- Top 5 Processes by Memory Usage 
- OS Version
- Uptime 
- Logged in Users
- Failed Login Attempts 

This is number 1 of [21 DevOps Projects](https://roadmap.sh/devops/projects) as per roadmap.sh

## Description From Site 

Goal of this project is to write a script to analyse server performance stats.
Requirements

You are required to write a script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

    Total CPU usage
    Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
    Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)
    Top 5 processes by CPU usage
    Top 5 processes by memory usage

Stretch goal: Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.
